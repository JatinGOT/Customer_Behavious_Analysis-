📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and interactive dashboard creation.
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

📁 Dataset


The dataset contains structured business/customer data.


Format: CSV (can be easily replaced with Excel or database tables).


Key attributes include:


Customer details


Purchase / transaction information


Demographic or categorical fields (age group, region, subscription status, etc.)




(Dataset used only for learning and analysis purposes.)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies


Python – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA


Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn




SQL – Data querying and analysis


Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server




Power BI – Interactive dashboard & data visualization


Jupyter Notebook – Python analysis


GitHub – Version control and project documentation



🔄 Project Steps


Data Loading


Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas.


Verified data types and structure.




Data Cleaning


Handled missing values.


Removed duplicates.


Corrected data types and standardized column values.




Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Analyzed distributions, trends, and patterns.


Identified key metrics and relationships.


Visualized insights using charts and graphs.




SQL Analysis


Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server.


Wrote SQL queries using:


SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY


Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)




Answered business questions using SQL.




Power BI Dashboard


Connected Power BI to SQL database / cleaned dataset.


Created KPIs, charts, and filters.


Designed a clean and interactive dashboard.




Reporting


Summarized findings and insights.


Highlighted trends and recommendations.





📈 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)


Trend analysis


Category-wise and demographic insights


Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration


(Dashboard designed with a recruiter-friendly and business-focused layout.)
